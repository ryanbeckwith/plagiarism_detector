# plagiarism_detector
 A functional plagiarism detector that utilizes a folder of source .docx files and compares their similarity to a folder of student submissions. The program includes an implementation for a functional .docx file reader, as well as several component classes that aid the functionality of the detector. Written as a part of an AP Computer Science course in Java.
 
## Running this program

All .docx files that are to be analyzed by the detector as student submissions must be placed in the "Submissions" folder, which must be named "Submissions" and must be located at the same sublevel as the "src" folder.\
All .docx files that are to be analyzed by the detector as sources must be placed in the "Sources" folder, which must be named "Sources" and must be located at the same sublevel as the "src" folder.\
A functional version of the JRE System Library (JavaSE 1.8 or higher) must be installed for the program to properly compile. This program was written using the Eclipse IDE, and is tailored to best suit the way that Eclipse compiles and executes Java programs. Use of other IDEs may result in unexpected disfunctionality.
